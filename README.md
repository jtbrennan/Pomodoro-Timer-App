# Timer-App
This app enables the user to set a time between 30 seconds and 10 minutes. The timer counts down from the set time. When the time runs out a Alert Message is displayed, aswell as a alarm sound played from the browser. The app uses JavaScript for functionality and CSS for the button and card designs. The app is fully responsive, using CSS responsive web development fundamentals. The app design automaticity adjusts depending on the device.
